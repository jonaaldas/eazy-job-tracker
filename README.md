# Job Tracker Kanban Flow

## Project Overview

This application is a job tracking system with a Kanban board interface that helps users organize their job applications through different stages. I developed it as a full-stack project to learn about deploying to Cloudflare Workers.

## Technical Details

For the server, I implemented Nitro framework because of:

- Its compatibility with Cloudflare Workers
- My familiarity with it from Nuxt development
- Straightforward deployment process
- The frontend is built with React and TypeScript.
- I utilized the HTML5 Drag and Drop API to create a smooth user experience for the drag-and-drop functionality.
- The frontend builds with Vite to the `dist` folder in the backend project.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Nitro
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Cloudflare Workers
- Database: Cloudflare D1
- Version Control: Git/GitHub

## Features

- Kanban board with customizable columns
- Drag-and-drop card management
- Responsive design
- Data persistence with D1 database
